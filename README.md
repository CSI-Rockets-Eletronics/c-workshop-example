Compile this project by opening it in VS Code with the Arduino extension.

To run this on the ESP32, make sure to add
`https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json` to the
"Arduino: Additional Urls" setting in VS Code. Then, open the Arduino Board
Manager in VS Code and install the "esp32" (by Expressive Systems) package.

Furthermore, copy the `rockets_client` library (download from
`https://github.com/CSI-Rockets-Eletronics/embedded-software-2023-2024/tree/main/arduino_libraries/rockets_client`)
into the Arduino Libraries folder (located at `Arduino/libraries`, usually in
your documents folder).
